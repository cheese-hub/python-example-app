# Publishing the Docker Image
## Login to DockerHub
Create an account on DockerHub if you haven't already.

You can login to this account from the `docker` CLI:
```bash
$ docker login
```

This will prompt you for your DockerHub username and password

## Pushing an Image to DockerHub
To push the image to DockerHub:
```bash
$ docker push cheesehub/python-example-app
```
OR
```bash
$ docker compose push
```

This will upload the latest image from your local machine to DockerHub.

## Pulling an Image from DockerHub
To pull the image from DockerHub:
```bash
$ docker pull cheesehub/python-example-app
```
OR
```bash
$ docker compose pull
```

This will fetch the latest image from DockerHub and download it to your local machine.
